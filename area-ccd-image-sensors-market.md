<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Area CCD Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Interline Transfer</li><li>Frame Line Transfer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Area CCD image sensors are categorized mainly into interline transfer and frame transfer types. Interline transfer sensors have a built-in mechanism to move charge from the imaging area to a separate readout area, allowing for faster readout and reduced image blur during exposure. In contrast, frame transfer sensors capture an entire frame and then transfer it to a separate storage area for readout. This often improves readout speed but can introduce a slight delay in capturing subsequent images.</p></p>
